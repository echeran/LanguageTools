# Sunuwar Testing Pages
I hope that this will help Sunuwar speakers to see the possibilities for digitizing the language.

This is definitely not intended as a replacement for the Unicode standardization process, but I hope that this will show people some of the possibilities. The
tools here may be useful for people to understand options for digitizing their languages and for trying new ideas.

1. The first page is a keyboard layout based on the original Sunuwar fonts, which substitute the Jenticha characters for Latin letters A-Z. It is just a first try, but I hope that people will use this.
Note that the keyboard on that page works on a desktop or laptop, and on that page, typing on the keyboard will create Jenticha. It is not necessary to use the mouse to select the characters!
The output of the keyboard is the same characters as the original font, but I've modified the font to produce different codes in the Unicode Private Use Area (PUA). This allows typing characters in Jenticha that do not conflict with Latin and other scripts.
A user can type in Jenticha. Setting the CapsLock switches the keyboard to an English layout.

2. The converter page https://languagetools-153419.appspot.com/suz/convertUI/ allows a user to paste in existing Sunuwar text into the upper area, or type directly from the keyboard using the encoded fonts with the character range A-Z.
Then the "Convert" button will transform the text to Public Use Area codes in the lower windows. These can be copied and used in documents with the PUA fonts (below.)

3. The updated PUA fonts are available on the resources page https://languagetools-153419.appspot.com/suz/downloads/. The Sunuwar Combined PUA has both Jenticha and Tikamuli scripts in Private Use Areas.
The only differences from the original fonts are:a. that the code values for Jenticha and Tikamuli are different,b. Jenticha and Tikamuli characters are included in separate ranges so both   can be used without conflicts.c. Latin and other scripts can be used in the same documents with Sunuwar text, as described above.
These fonts can be downloaded and used on most desktops or laptops, but keyboards are needed to create the PUA character codes in applications other than the test website. We can use KeyMan to create such keyboards if they would be useful to the communities. Please let me know if this would be useful.

4. The links on the right side point to the existing proposals for Jenticha and Tikamuli standardization in addition to the above pages.
I am very interested to learn if any of this is useful, and would be happy to talk with you and others about your needs and ideas.
