	Name
	Book of calling back the Khon (likqhogqxonq)
	Note
	The word xonq [khɔn⁶] has not been translated but rendered as  khon. If it were to be translated, terms like ‘spirit’ or ‘soul’ might be used. However khon is not really the same as the Western concept of either ‘spirit’ or ‘soul’. Terwiel (1980:71) uses the term ‘vitality’.

	  In preparation of this analysis, an Aiton version written by Chaw Seng Hun Phalung (cWsigqhugq falugq) (cau³ sɛŋ¹ huŋ) literally ‘resp-diamond-dazzling’, the father of Nabin Shyam Phalung, who died before the Assam earthquake of 1950, when Nabin was a child.
  Several Phake versions, one copied by Aithown Che Chakap, and another in the possession of Ee Nyan Khet, were also consulted.
	Translation
	  The first draft of this analysis was prepared by Stephen Morey in September 2000, based on the examination of a tape explaining the text recorded with Sa Myat Chowlik in February 2000.
  The text was revised with the assistance of Nabin Shyam Phalung in March 2001. 
  The text was then further revised with the assistance of Aithown Che Chakap, and various pandits from Namphakey village, namely Ai Che Let Hailung, Sam Thon Wingkyen, Ai Chanta Thoumoung and Ee Nyan Khet Thoumong in late March 2001. Since the final translation was done with the help of Phake pandits, the phonemicisation is in Phake.

TRANSLATION


        Now is the time to search for the customs of our ancestors from former times, from long, long ago. They established this process, and we have continued it in their way. Long ago grandfather Singpha, together with sweet-hearted grandmother Hola, began this custom. We have heard about this for many, many years. Up to this time we have not failed to follow our grandparents, even unto the generations of the children and grandchildren.
        The time has come to mix these sweet sounds and tell them. The troubled khon of our beloved grandchild is lost, and we do not know where it is. He is feverish, very cold and disturbed in his heart. 
        Now your grandchild has every requisite, banana, sugarcane and all the sweet foods. The grandfather will come to beg the troubled khon of our beloved grandchild to take this fine pink satin shirt. 
        Oh, sweet-hearted grandfather at the fireplace, perform this ceremony, Oh listen! With a rice tripod, pots, saucepan and water dipper, oh listen! Now your grandchild has both fish and rice, together with fragrant water from the water jar and banana, sugar cane and other sweet things, as well as all the scented foods collected by our grandparents over a long period, with banana, sugar cane and utensils, with an axe, a hoe, a sharp sickle and a lance and a fish trap for catching fish on the edge of the flowing where the white sands are.
        All things we give you, oh respected grandfather, who sits at the bright glare of the fire. Please go and search out the good khon of our beloved grandson in every country. 
        If it is in a very far away place, in any direction, please grandfather, search for it in every channel and stream, and under every flat stone. Get the khon of our small grandchild, so that our grandchild may stay for a long time and complete many years without illness; so that he may have a smiling, laughing and happy face. Oh grandfather who sits at the three-pronged cooking stand, with a round rim, by the fire of red charcoals, perform this ceremony, oh listen!
        Now go to look for the khon in other far away countries. We request you to go quickly and bring it back. Do not rest anywhere. Now your grandchild has both a sickle and a cleaver. If the khon goes to another bad place, search for it. Some say it is in a wild forest, or a place where there is pile of green thatch. Oh grandfather, now take the sharp sickle, and cut and tear it out.
        If the troubled khon is in the river where clear water flows, Oh grandfather, take the fish trap and search for it at the edge of the river and among the rocks. Allow the khon of the little grandchild to come. We request you to go quickly and bring it back. Do not rest anywhere.
        Then, if you cannot find it in that place, go and look for it further. Take the hoe and axe and search among the thousands of planks and coffins. It may be mixed up inside these planks which are arranged one after the other in a heap. If the khon gets to go to a bad place, in that place which others call wild forest, a place where there is pile of thatch, where there are big coffins.
        If the troubled khon has gone to live inside the hollow of a tree, or in an overhanging stone, if there is a good khon staying in that place, then catch it and package it into a cloth and bring it, we request. Oh, respected grandfather at the cooking tripod, who has remained by the fire for a long time, oh listen!
        Please go to search for the good khon of our beloved grandson in every country, in every place, up hill and down dale, in places far and near.
        If the khon is in a very distant place where the sky meets the earth, Grandfather will place set his legs and roam to the bordering countries to search for it. If it is very very far away, Grandfather will start searching along that straight road. 
        Let the khon of the little grandchild come and reach us. Oh khon, we request you to stay happily inside the house, speak and become well. 
        If the good khon is staying in a large and deep pit, our respected grandfather will take a shovel to dig it out and find it. If you do not easily find the khon, please go to search for it in the big deep thick forest. If you meet it, bring it back. As it is in a bad way and suffering illness, come quickly so that it will become better.
        If after searching for the good khon in that deep forest, you don’t get it, Oh Grandfather, now go and search on the open ground, on the dry rice fields and the flat wet paddy fields, in the creeks and drains and lowland fields. If the troubled khon of our beloved grandchild has become separated, and is far away, when the time will come to bring it back, is not known. The grandchild is ill, he is feverish, he is burning with a cold fever. Please, grandfather, again go to search everywhere.
        If you meet the troubled khon of our beloved grandchild, bring it back, we request you. Go and search at the borders and look everywhere. Go and search thoroughly in the creeks and drains and look everywhere. 
        If you don’t get to see it, then go to search for the evil spirits, the stupid and the wicked persons. Take the long handled lance, with the crossbow. Grandfather, go to look for the very bad spirits on the open ground outside of the village. If the bad spirits will still not release the khon, take the thin blade of the lance and stab their sides. If they grab it tightly and will not release it, take the crossbow and striking at them, shoot them. If they still don’t release it, take a sharp sword with a razor sharp edge and go to chop them.  Make the bad spirits run away, far, far away. Then the spirits will easily release the khon. Oh, respected grandfather, who sits by the large fire, please go and search for the troubled khon and watch over it so it may stay quietly with the grandchild, we request you.
        Go searching in many places, in the open ground outside the edges of the village. If you have searched for all the bad spirits, don’t fail to look thoroughly. If you don’t manage to get it quickly, afterwards, go and search at the borders of the country and in every place.        
        At that time the cold bad spirits have gathered in pandemonium, bustling without ceasing. Others call it a city, a market for selling khons. In that case, grandfather, please go there and again search everywhere thoroughly. Search and bring the khon of our grandchild back home, to this room, we request you.
        If the bad spirits have tightly caught it and will not release it, Grandfather, take a very big long stick and beat them. If they don’t release it, and put it down, bring all the many utensils which were given. 
        If they give up the khon, our hearts will be glad and full of hope. Bring it back to this house, and let it eat peacefully, we request you. Thus you have roamed and sought it in every place,
        If it does not have strong eyes or if it does not clearly know the many things in the cemetery which is covered with green thatch, then get the bad khon and bind it up and make it stay at the cemetery. Go walking and looking everywhere to search for it.
        If you see the troubled khon of the beloved grandchild, bring it here, we request you.


        Welcome, do come, oh khon! Come and eat fish and rice! Come and drink the clear water which we have put into the pot. Come and eat banana, sugar can and all sweet things! Come and eat the fragrant food which over a long time grandmother and grandfather have given you.
        Come and be welcome, all 30 khons which live in the body, complete your full life, don’t go. Come all 90 khons which live in the body. Come and stay with your owner for a thousand years. Do not go and take off and wander in other countries. Come and stay with your younger and elder siblings. Come and stay quietly in his body, and don’t go away. Don’t go walking about here and there many times, coming and going.        Let him reach old age, the age of white hair. Don’t go away and leave him with any epidemic or fever.
        Altogether there are 120 types of khons in people.
        Come here, live quietly and reach the age of a hundred, eating well and peacefully, oh khon, we request you! Stay and live your complete life and stay well. Live for a long time and without sadness or weakness. Every day, wait quietly in this body. Stay together with your father, mother, elder and younger siblings, and eat at the dinner table with the eating sticks, here in this house. Do not let the bad fever stay and burn you up in sadness. Stay quietly in this body for a thousand years and do not go away, oh khon, we request you. Do not let sadness come to touch the heart. We request you to stay happily for a long time, oh khon, oh khon!

Notes:        * In Shan hYkqH means, ‘to begin to work; begin by doing a little, because it is declared to be an auspicious day.’  
        Nabin Shyam Phalung stated that in Aiton hikqna (hɛk³ naa²) means ‘start ploughing the fields’; and hikqxW (hɛk³ naa²) ‘start to cut the paddy’.
        ** In the Aiton text this was written as wja  (waa² wai³)
        *** There was some debate about the meaning of this. Ai Che Let Hailung stated that it was an abbreviation for  Aupama (u⁴ pa¹ mā¹) ‘example’.

‘From the time that grandfather Singpha began to make (this custom).’


Notes:        * the Aiton version has figq. ekafigq is given as ‘at first starting’. See below (5)
        Nabin Shyam stated that pUsigqfa (puu¹ siŋ¹ phaa³) and yasigqfa (yaa² siŋ¹ phaa³) are the names of the god and goddess who allowed the Tai people to come down from heaven.

‘Together with sweet hearted grandmother Hola, they began (this custom)’


Notes:        * Nabin stated that Hola was the name of Pu Singpha’s wife. The Phakes stated that the correct name is yaehasa (yā⁵ ho⁶ sā²).
        **  perhaps Shan fYgq ‘along with, together with’ - he explains it as meaning that both Grandfather and grandmother started the work.

‘We have heard of this for many many years.’


Notes:        * Nabin stated that this means ‘heard’. It is literally ‘hear-be’, but note Shan  ginqLpYnq ‘to feel, to experience, to be affected by’.

‘Up to this time we have not failed to follow our grandparents.’


Notes: ya  yā¹ is usually a prohibitive particle (as in Standard Thai), which in speech would be expressed with pi pi¹. It does appear that this sentence represents a ‘double negation’ making a positive. 


In the Aiton version, the first few words are given as: xnqhotqetacU.

Note:         Sao Tern Moeng (1995:68) translates xonq as ‘fairy or spirit attached to a person from birth, similar to a guardian angel’, and offers an alternative spelling xTnq. She also refers to the xogqHxjG ‘basket and its content. viz. two bundles of salt, two of tea, two bunches of bananas, two bracelets and two hands of thread used as a wedding gift to a bride; also as an offering to spirits and to call back a fairy when a person is very ill or shocked into a daze. hogqOxonq hpqOxonq (an ancient custom).

Notes:        * There was some discussion about this word. Nabin Shyam read it as pa² ‘to carry (the fever). Aithown Che Chakap stated that it meant with, which is suggested by Shan pa: ‘be with, have with’, in itself possibly related to the word for ‘carry’. The Phake pandits suggested that it might better be read as epa.

Notes:        * error in MS - written sop.
        The meaning of phā⁶ ŋāp¹ was explained ‘under a flat stone’. The Phake pandits explained that it referred to a type of drain. Nabin stated that ‘in river if there is a stone, under that it is called fagpq phaa¹ ŋaap¹. 
        In the Aiton version, pUcW is omitted and sopq is written sokq - the latter being correct; ex is written ek - which is incorrect

        Aithown Che stated that the meaning of xa khā² thatch, and that the meaning was ‘a green place covered with thatch’, where ca means ‘to cover’

148.1)        cI        cupq        cI        cupq        cI        cupq /

        ‘Chi Chup Chi Chup Chup.’ $L=Aiton$


Both of these are the incantations used for calling the khon. They have to be used first and last to call the khon.
