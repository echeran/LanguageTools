<h2>Multilingual Data Entry</h2>
<p>This tools allows simple creation of text data in multiple languages.
This data is created in the browser, and can be downloaded as a tab-separated value file.
<p>This data can then be loaded into a spreadsheet or text application.</p>

<p><em>Important: </em>The data entered with this tool is not transmitted to any online application or website.
  It can be downloaded to the local computer, but is not made available to anyone or any entity
 without the user's specific action.
</p>

<h3>Entering data:</h3>
<ol>
  <li>Type a word or phrase. Edit as needed.</li>
  <li>Touch the Enter key. The phrase appears in the table below.</li>
  <li>The keyboard changes to English and the input area is chosen again.</li>
  <li>Type the corresponding phrase and touch Enter when done.</li>
  <li>Note that:</li>
  <ol>
    <li>the English is added to the second column of the table,</li>
    <li>the input area is now set to Adlam with its keyboard. Text direction is set correctly.</li>
  </ol>
  <li>Continue for as many entries as desired.</li>
  </ol>

<h3>Editing data:</h3>
<p>To fix or update entries,
<ol>
  <li>lick on the item in the table.</li>
  <li>The text is loaded into the text area and the appropriate keyboard is selected.</li>
  <li>Make needed edits.</li>
  <li>Touch Enter. The updated text is placed back in that cell.</li>
</ol>

<h3>Saving to file:</h3>
<p>To save the data to your computer:
</p>
<ol>
  <li>put a name in the field "Data label".</li>
  <li>Then touch "Download TSV".</li>
</ol>
<p>This creates a locale file in your downloads folder. The file is  stored in tab-separated-value format which can be opened with a spreadsheet program or any simple text editor.
</p>

<h3>Uploading a file:</h3>
<p>An existing TSV file can be uploaded from the local disk by:
</p>
<ol>
  <li>Select a file with "To load a .tsv file:"</li>
  <li>Touch the "Upload data file .tsv" button</li>
  <li>You will see the data entered into the table.</li>
</ol>
<p>After loading a file, adding more lines, editing entries, and saving work as described above.</p>

<h3>Multiline cells</h3>
<p>When adding data, shift-Enter creates a new line within the cell without moving to the next entry.
This allows typing more than one line in an entry. This could be for multiple definitions, for example.
Editing works fine, too.
</p>
<p>Download of multiple lines works, with lines separated by a special set of characters
  "&langle;NL&rangle;". This allows loading into a spreadsheet in a single cell, but does
  not automatically become new lines within that cell.  In Excel, it's possible to do a
  Replace command to turn these into new lines within the cell.
</p>
<p>Uploading such a TSV file works well with the dictionaryN site as long as the "&langle;NL&rangle;"
  text is used to indicate the line breaks within the cell.
