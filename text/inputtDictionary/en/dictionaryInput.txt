Instructions: Type a word or phrase for the first language in the upper left box.

When finished with that, use the "tab" key to move to the next box. The keyboard for that language will be activated,

the user easily type the equivalent in that language.

Then "enter" adds the line into a table below, clears the inputs, and returns to the upper left box.

Edit for each line works as above, with "enter" filling in the edited line with new information.

None of this data is communicated or stored online with this. The downloaded file is only stored on the user's local
disk. Since it's a tab-separated-value file, it can be loaded into any spreadsheet program or modified with simple text
editors.

If there's a need to edit data, the .tsvÂ file can be uploaded easily and editing or adding new data is just as above.
